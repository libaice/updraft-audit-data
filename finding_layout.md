### [S-#] TITLE (Root Cause + Impact)

### The Write-Up Structure

1. **Title**: A title should be succinct and clear. A best practice is to adhere to the `Root Cause + Impact` rule of thumb.



1. **Description**: This is a brief explanation of the problem, widely enhanced by using markdown and clear naming conventions for our variables.



1. **Impact**: The impact should be clear and concise in how, in plain language, is describes the affects the vulnerability has on the protocol.



1. **Proof of Code**: A vital part of a good report, this section proves how someone could exploit the detailed vulnerability by walking through the process programmatically.



1. **Recommended Mitigation**: This is where our expertise shines. Our focus in the recommendation should be in making the protocol more secure, advising specific changes or considerations that should be made to mitigate the reported vulnerability and adding value by offering solutions instead of just pointing out problems.
